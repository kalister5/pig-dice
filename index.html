    <h1>Let's play Pig Dice!</h1>
    <h1>Roll The Dice </h1>
    <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945.[1] As with many games of folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Commercial variants of Pig include Pass the Pigs, Pig Dice,[2] and Skunk. Pig is
      commonly used by mathematics teachers to teach probability concepts.</p>
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br>

      1:If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
      2:If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>
      3:If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
      The first player to score 100 or more points wins.</p>
